# To-Do Web App

## What is this project?
### This is a website I've built to function as a simple To-do list app. It can add new todos, complete them. 

## What did I use? 
### Streamlit - It's a python library for building websites, and it has many built-in features. It works on top of HTML and CSS, so learning this syntax would be sufficient. 
### In the backend, I did basic list manipulation, loops for iterating through the list, etc, used a basic text file for storing all the todos. It's all basic python code.
